The search for the perfect playlist.

A collbrative effort between Brenton Durkee and Dana Lee. Created at HackRU, a student hackathon hosted at Rutgers University.
Won best use of Amazon Web Services at HackRU.

Designed to use a variety of cross-searches in order to form a playlist around a particular keyword or mood.

Key features:
  * uses found results from one service as the basis for search in another service
  * results are primarily based on user naming and keyword tagging
  * due to the avoidance of pre-selected words and matches, should always return a unique result and playlist despite seed work entered

The backend is designed to display the server and provide native endpoints for the frontend, the frontend does most of the general work (crossreferencing and such) to make the results more apparant and immediate.

Test server is currently hosted at http://music.brentondurkee.com
